# Hello! ðŸ’«

Welcome to the first iteration of my GitHub profile. 

I'm currently pursuing double-degree studies towards an **MSc in Financial Mathematics** at KTH and a **BSc in Business and Economics** at SSE. On track to graduate in June 2025. Moreover, I'm working part-time as a **Junior Quantitative Analyst** at SÃ¶derberg & Partners. 

Looking for all opportunities to meet new people, continue developing my skills and making an impact.

### Main areas of interest
While my interests are multifaceted, the main ones can be summarized as: 

* Mathematics
* Applied Statistics
* Programming
* Data Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Quantitative Finance


### Languages
Here's a collection of the programming languages and software I have experience in.

## ðŸ“ˆ Predicting Equity Fund Returns: The Impact of the Momentum Factor on Performance

In collaboration with SÃ¶derberg & Partners, my bachelor thesis in applied mathematics and industrial economics was developed together with my co-author Pontus Hovberger. In the thesis, the impact of the momentum factor in equity fund returns is evaluated over the period 2000-2023. A multifactor model is developed, using factor attribution to explain the impact on fund performance over time by factors such as risk, size, value-growth orientation and momentum. Conclusions are made that while momentum have previously been successful in predicting future returns, particularly for growth-oriented funds, recent market situations have lead to underperformance.

Here is an illustration of factor coefficients over time, highlighting the momentum crashes following the financial crisis in 2008 and during Covid-19.
