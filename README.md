# Hello! üí´

Welcome to the first iteration of my GitHub profile. 

I'm currently pursuing double-degree studies towards an **MSc in Financial Mathematics** at KTH and a **BSc in Business and Economics** at SSE. On track to graduate in June 2025. Moreover, I'm working part-time as a **Junior Quantitative Analyst** at S√∂derberg & Partners. 

Looking for all opportunities to meet new people, continue developing my skills and making an impact.

### Main areas of interest
While my interests are multifaceted, the main ones can be summarized as: 

* Mathematics
* Applied Statistics
* Programming
* Data Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Quantitative Finance


### Languages
Here's a collection of the programming languages and software I have experience in.

## üìà Predicting Equity Fund Returns: Impact of Momentum on Performance

In collaboration with S√∂derberg & Partners, the bachelor thesis in Applied Mathematics and Industrial Economics was developed together with my co-author Pontus Hovberger. In the thesis, the impact of the momentum factor on equity fund returns is evaluated over the period 2000-2023. A multifactor model is developed, using factor attribution to explain the impact on fund performance over time by factors such as risk, size, value-growth orientation and momentum. Conclusions are made that while momentum have previously been successful in predicting future returns, particularly for growth-oriented funds, recent market situations have lead to underperformance.

Here is an illustration of factor coefficients over time, illustrating the premium generated by risk exposure to each factor. Note the significant momentum crashes following the financial crisis in 2008 and during the Covid-19 pandemic.

## üï∏Ô∏è Implementing a Neural Network from scratch in Python

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hbrnld&repo=NN-from-scratch&title_color=000000)](https://github.com/hbrnld/NN-from-scratch)

Implementation of a 2-layer feed forward neural network from scratch using Python and Numpy library. The network is trained on labelled images from the CIFAR-10 data set with the purpose of classifying the images. Implementation is done by defining the architecture, initializing parameters and subsequently training the model using mini-batch gradient descent. Backpropogation is used to compute the gradients, finding analytical solutions required to update the weights and bias. Next, we extend the network to a $k$-layer network to assess whether predictive accuracy is increased by using a deeper network. Main code and report are found in the repository.
