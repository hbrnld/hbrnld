# Hello! ðŸ’«

Welcome to the first iteration of my GitHub profile. 

I'm currently pursuing double-degree studies towards an *MSc in Financial Mathematics* at KTH and a *BSc in Business and Economics* at SSE. On track to graduate in June 2025. Moreover, I'm working part-time as a *Junior Quantitative Analyst* at SÃ¶derberg & Partners. 

### Main areas of interest
While my interests are multifaceted, my academic commitments lie within the intersection of *mathematics and finance*. Including, but not limited to: 

* Mathematics
* Applied statistics
* Programming
* Data Analysis
* Machine learning
* Quantitative finance

Looking for all opportunities to meet new people, continue developing my skills and making an impact.
